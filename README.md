LDU factorization (step by step)
<br>
LDU Factorization (also known as LDU Decomposition) is a method of matrix factorization that decomposes a square matrix A into the product of three matrices:
<br>
L: a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal
D: a diagonal matrix
U: an upper triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal
<br>
This repository provides an implementation of the LDU Factorization allowing you to easily decompose matrices into their L, D, and U components.
